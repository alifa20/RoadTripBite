# Progress

✅ Search icon loading

✅ Ads for the main page.

✅ Estimated arrival

✅ show cafes and restaurant in the footer

✅ navigate to map for the restaurants

- Need to publish the app to the app store.

- Ads needs to be on production.

## Remaining

- Should be able to self-heal estimated arrival if user already has search results.

- Should fix Going by train or walking or other options. It should be in a way that can change estimated arrival time based on different means of transport

- Should be able to search for petrol stations and hotels. This means than in our backend database we should save these options separately.
  This should be in place so that we can query correct data based on user's filter. For instance when querying the system, we shouldn't mix hotels with
  restaurants when filter is only restaurants
